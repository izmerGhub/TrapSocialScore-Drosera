🚨 A custom Drosera Trap that simulates social reputation verification via mock Discord score.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

TrapSocialScore is a smart contract Trap that:
- Collects a **hardcoded reputation score** (mocked as 1337).
- Checks if the score is greater than 1000.
- Responds with your Discord username ("izmers") if qualified.

This idea simulates **reputation-based role gating** and demonstrates how on-chain identity or community trust scores could work in the future.
